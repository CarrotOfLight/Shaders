# Shaders

Self Evaluation; I did come to class and i did try to do everything to the best of my abilities

Reflection
I Was able to accomplish everything as done in the Lecture relatively simply (except for reflection shader which just did not work for some reason)

My strengths in this project where how well i tinkered with how everything worked in a gameplay perspective
I created a moveable mouse that could help me with testing how the different shaders would work in game with a moving object.

My weaknesses where that i did not fully understand how the shaders would work so i had to do alot of tinkering to get them to work. An example is for the stencil shader; I was not able to fully implement the stencil shader as done in the lecture, instead i did it a slightly different way.
